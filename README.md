LLAMA â€“ Low Level Abstraction of Memory Access
==============================================

![LLAMA](documentation/images/logo_399x134.png)

LLAMA is a C++11 template header-only library for the abstraction of memory
access patterns. It distinguishes between the view of the algorithm on
the memory and the real layout in the background. This enables performance
portability for multicore, manycore and gpu application with the very same code.
